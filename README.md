# XbimAzure
This is an example application of xBIM toolkit for cloud deployment. It is not intended for enterprise use without further development. It is tied to Microsoft Azure technologies and it won't work out of the box as it doesn't contain connection information and it expects certain resources to exist (like queues, blob storage tables and others).
